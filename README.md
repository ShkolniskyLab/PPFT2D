# PPFT2D
Two-dimensional pseudo-polar Fourier Transform

MATLAB package to compute the 2D pseudo-polar Fourier transform and the discrete 2-D Radon transform.

The functions are written in Matlab and do not use any external packages.

All functions are documented using Matlab's comments. For help on any function in the package type help `function_name`

See XXX for more details

## Getting started
1. Add folder to the MATLAB path (you can run initpath for that).
2. Run `testRadon.m`
3. See XXX for more details
